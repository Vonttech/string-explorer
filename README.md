# Javascript String Explorer
String manipulation is commonly used when working with forms and JavaScript. If you're a beginner to the language, this resource may help you find the correct method that does exactly what you're looking for.

I made this to help people find the correct String method a bit more naturally and also for me to learn VueJS.

I selected the methods I think are the most important and most used in real situations. Keep in mind that his resource is not intended to replace the full documentation, which is why I also linked the MDN docs to each method.
